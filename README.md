        ## Summary
        This project was auto-generated for the TDS Project 1 in response to the brief:
        "Your assigned company: Assurant (AIZ), CIK 0001267238.

Fetch https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK0001267238/dei/EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding.json (set a descriptive User-Agent per SEC guidance).
Read `.entityName`. Filter `.units.shares[]` for entries whose `fy` > "2020" and
includes a numeric `val`.
Save `data.json` with this structure:
`{"entityName": "Assurant", "max": {"val": ..., "fy": ...}, "min": {"val": ..., "fy": ...}}`
where `max` and `min` refer to the highest and lowest `.val`. Break ties however you like.

Render a visually appealing `index.html` where:
- `<title>` and `<h1>` must include the live `entityName`.
- The max/min figures are clearly marked with these IDs:
  `share-entity-name`,
  `share-max-value`, `share-max-fy`,
  `share-min-value`, `share-min-fy`.

If the page is opened as `index.html?CIK=0001018724` (or any other 10-digit CIK),
`fetch()` from the SEC endpoint for that CIK using any proxy, e.g. AIPipe,
replace every ID listed above and the title and H1 without reloading the page.

Also commit the attachment uid.txt as-is."

        ## Usage
        This is a static site. The deployed version is available via GitHub Pages.

        ## Code Explanation
        The `index.html` file is a self-contained application generated by an LLM. 
        Any attachments, like `data.csv`, are fetched by the HTML file.
